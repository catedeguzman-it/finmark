# FinMark Modernization Proposal

## Executive Summary

FinMark Corporation's legacy Financial Information Management System, implemented in 2014, has become a critical business liability. After a decade of operation, the legacy infrastructure that the system was built upon can no longer meet current business requirements and poses significant operational risks. This assessment and proposal outlines the compelling case for complete system modernization through a cloud-native approach to restore operational efficiency and ensure business continuity.

## 1. Current State Analysis

### Legacy System Infrastructure

The current system operates on technology standards from 2014, built on an infrastructure that was designed for a different era of business requirements. The system architecture reflects the constraints and assumptions of that time period, when cloud computing was just starting and business operations were primarily local rather than global.

#### System Requirements  
*(Source: System Requirements Document v1.0, March 2014)*

- **Operating System**: Windows Server 2008 R2 *(end-of-life since 2020)*
- **Database**: SQL Server 2008 *(end-of-support since 2019)*
- **Hardware**: 4GB RAM, 500GB storage capacity
- **Network**: 100Mbps infrastructure
- **Browser Support**: Internet Explorer 8.0
- **Concurrency**: Maximum 50 concurrent users supported *(FR1.2)*
- **File Upload**: 10MB maximum file upload size *(FR2.3)*

### Current System Architecture

#### Overview  
The existing architecture relies on a **single, monolithic backend application**, which consolidates multiple critical functions—including authentication, transaction processing, reporting, and session management—into one tightly coupled unit. While this centralized approach was initially straightforward, it now severely limits **scalability, robustness, and maintainability**.

## 2. Core Components of the Current System

### Frontend (Web/Mobile Interfaces)

- Serves as the primary interaction layer for end-users, including internal employees and external clients.
- Provides access to:
  - Account management  
  - Order placement  
  - Financial reports  
  - Planning requests  
- Communicates directly with backend services via **internal APIs**, which:
  - Lack version control  
  - Do not follow modern security standards  

---

### Backend (Monolithic Application)

- Handles all **core business logic**:
  - Authentication  
  - Order management  
  - Transaction processing  
  - Report generation  
- Processes all user sessions internally, without:
  - Dedicated session management tools  
  - Middleware separation  
- Suffers from **performance bottlenecks** during multi-user or high-load operations

---

### Internal APIs

- Serve as a communication layer between frontend and backend  
- **Not versioned**, **not secured**  
- Lacking:
  - Input validation  
  - Authentication  
  - Robust error handling  
- Result:
  - Vague error messages  
  - Frequent system crashes during unexpected load conditions

---

### Database (Centralized SQL)

- Stores:
  - Transactional records  
  - User accounts  
  - Inventory data  
  - Activity logs  
- Performance issues due to:
  - Poor query optimization  
  - No indexing strategy  
  - No replication for load distribution or failover  
- No redundancy or high availability mechanisms in place

---

### Authentication Module

- Provides only **basic login/logout functionality**
- Missing critical security features:
  - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)  
  - Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)  
  - Session expiry and management  
- Leaves the system vulnerable to unauthorized access and poor auditability

---

## Conclusion

The limitations and risks of the current system architecture underscore the urgency of FinMark's transition to a **cloud-native, microservices-oriented** infrastructure. A modern approach will mitigate existing bottlenecks, enhance security, and support the scalability required for future business growth.
